# stats220

## Welcome to my STATS 220 repo!

I am a second year at the *University of Auckland* doing a Bachelor of Science (BSc) specialising in Data Science. I will be using this page to display my work on **STATS 220 projects** and keep track of my progress.

I am aiming to become a great *data scientist* like my passionate lecturer who is a role model for a student aspiring to become a data scientist one day and will learn these modules this semester:

* Creating HTML using modern technologies
* Creating dynamic reporting systems
* Creating new variables and data tables
* Creating static and dynamic visualisations
* Creating data from digital sources
* Creating automated code-driven processes

For my first project the main components are to:

1. Create a GitHub account and GitHub page 
2. Create a meme with `R` code in R studio using the `Magick` package.
3. Create an animated GIF using `R` code in R studio using the `Magick` package.
4. Make an HTML file to showcase my work
5. Write a report on the project

**Thank you!**
